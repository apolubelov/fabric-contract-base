Scala library to write smart contracts on [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric) block chain platform.
This library wraps [Fabric chain code java](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-java) and adds some functionality to make chain code looks more like a real life contract (smart contract).

Current state is **work in progress**
